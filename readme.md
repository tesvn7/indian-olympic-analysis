## Introduction
This project is a Streamlit application that showcases data science and machine learning techniques. The application allows users to interact with the data, visualize the results, and explore the insights.

## Requirements

### Virtual Environment Setup (Optional)
1. Create a new virtual environment:
   - **Windows**: `python -m venv env`
   - **macOS/Linux**: `python3 -m venv env`

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows**: `env\Scripts\activate`
   - **macOS/Linux**: `source env/bin/activate`

3. Install the required packages:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Run the Streamlit application: `streamlit run app.py`

This will start the Streamlit application and open it in your default web browser.

## Features
The Streamlit application provides the following features:

1. **Data Exploration**: Users can upload a dataset and explore its characteristics, such as data types, missing values, and basic statistics.
2. **Visualization**: The application offers various visualization tools, including scatter plots, bar charts, and line plots, to help users understand the data.
3. **Machine Learning**: The application includes simple machine learning models, such as linear regression and k-nearest neighbors, that users can train and evaluate on the uploaded dataset.
4. **Interactivity**: The application is designed to be interactive, allowing users to adjust parameters and see the results in real-time.

## Project Structure
The project structure is as follows:

- `app.py`: The main Streamlit application file.
- `requirements.txt`: The file containing the necessary package names and versions.
- `data/`: Directory for storing the dataset(s) used in the project.
- `models/`: Directory for storing the trained machine learning models.
- `utils/`: Directory for storing any utility functions or modules used in the project.
